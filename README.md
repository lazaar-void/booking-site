# Appointment Booking Module

A comprehensive **appointment booking system** for Drupal 10/11. Customers book appointments with specialised advisers at agency branches through an interactive 6-step wizard powered by FullCalendar.

## Features

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Booking Wizard** | 6-step guided form at `/book-an-appointment` with AJAX navigation and TempStore state |
| **Calendar** | FullCalendar v6 TimeGrid for interactive date/time slot selection with live availability |
| **Entities** | Two custom content entities: **Agency** and **Appointment** (revisionable, publishable) |
| **Adviser Profiles** | Extended User entity with agency assignment, JSON working hours, and taxonomy specialisations |
| **Slot Engine** | Calculates availability from adviser hours, subtracts existing bookings, prevents double-booking |
| **Email Notifications** | Confirmation, modification, and cancellation emails to both customer and adviser via Queue API |
| **User Dashboard** | `/my-appointments` — view, edit, and cancel bookings |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Views-based listing at `/admin/structure/appointment` with filters, bulk actions, and CSV export |
| **CSV Import** | Bulk import agencies and advisers at `/admin/config/appointment/import` |
| **CTA Block** | "Book an Appointment" block plugin for placement anywhere on the site |
| **Modification Flow** | 3-step lookup → verify → edit flow for appointment modification |
| **Cancellation** | Confirmation form with ownership check and soft-delete |
